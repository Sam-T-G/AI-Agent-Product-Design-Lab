# Documentation Reset

The previous documentation set has been removed. This repo now reflects the current working build of the AI Agent Product Design Lab. Fresh reference docs will be authored from this point forward.

## What exists today
- FastAPI backend with session-scoped agents and run orchestration
- Next.js frontend for managing agents and running conversations
- Gemini integration where users provide their own API key at runtime

## Next steps for docs
1. Capture an updated architecture overview once the new direction stabilizes
2. Rewrite the setup guide after the deployment workflow is finalized
3. Add focused guides (agent editing, session management, running workflows) based on the pared-down feature set

Until those sections are written, use the root README for setup instructions.
