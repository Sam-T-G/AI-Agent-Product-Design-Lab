# Product Vision

## Overview

AI Agent Product Design Lab enables users to design, compose, and deploy modular AI agents for product development. Create new agent instances dynamically from the UI, visually wire parent/child relationships, and edit each agent's independent prompting without code.

Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and a Python backend that orchestrates prompting and execution with Google's Gemini models.

## Core Goals

- **No-code agent composition**: Add agents with a plus button, drag/connect visual endpoints to define parent/child (supervisor/worker) relationships.
- **Modular agents**: Each agent has a role, tools, and prompt. Agents can work under existing or newly created parent agents.
- **Editable prompts**: Users can modify each agent's system prompt and behaviors directly in the UI.
- **Gemini-powered reasoning**: Use your Gemini API key to run prompts and multi-agent workflows.

## Target Users

- Product managers and designers who want to experiment with AI agents without coding
- Teams building AI-powered products who need to prototype agent workflows
- Developers who want to visualize and manage agent architectures

## Success Metrics

- Users can create a multi-agent workflow in under 5 minutes
- Zero-code required to compose and run agent graphs
- Clear visual feedback during agent execution
- Prompt editing leads to measurable improvements in agent outputs
